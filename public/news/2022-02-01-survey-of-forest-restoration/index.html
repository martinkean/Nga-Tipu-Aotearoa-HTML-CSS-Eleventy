          <h3 class="plantpage__card__desc__h3">Te Uru Rākau – New Zealand Forest Service has commissioned Forbes Ecology Limited to survey of the actual costs associated with native forest restoration activities. The work relates to an evaluation of native forest grant schemes and also Government’s obligations to investigate native forestry recommendations made by the Climate Change Commission.</h3>
              
          <p class="plantpage__card__desc__intro">The survey presents a very important opportunity to gather emprical data on actual forest restoration costs. We recognise your experience in this area and encourage you to participate in the survey.</p>

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The survey has been grouped into six topic areas and a separate automated survey form is available for each area. The six topic areas which we are seeking information on actual costs as they relate to restoration of native forest ecosystems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forest restoration planting</li>
<li>Land retirement and reversion to native forest</li>
<li>Enrichment planting</li>
<li>Remnant management</li>
<li>Animal pest control</li>
<li>Plant pest control</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the more people who are able to contribue to this survey the better – so please, if you can recommend people that have experience in these areas that might be willing to particpate in this survey please do so Survey responses are automatically anonymised.</p>

    <p>
      The Plant Names Database lists over 46,000 names and is a primary source of information for Ngā Tipu o Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants. The purpose of the New Zealand Plant Names Database is to provide an authoritative record of the scientific names, taxonomic concepts (i.e., synonymies), and biostatus for the lichens, liverworts, mosses, ferns, freshwater algae and seed plants in New Zealand. It also records the associated literature, vernacular and Māori names, as well as recently published keys and descriptions for some taxa. Editorial work on the Plant Names Database is ongoing and as new treatments, taxa and naturalisations are published these are added to the database.
