        <h2>Why I have selected this species:</h2>
<p>To me Leptinella serrulata is a real icon of our eastern South Island dryland ecosystems, although very few kiwis have heard of this special little plant, let alone seen it. It is a very cryptic species; being tiny, prostrate, and well-camouflaged in the naturally grey/brown dryland habitats it occupies. The whakatauki “Ahakoa he iti he pounamu” seems very appropriate for the dryland button daisy, as it means “despite being small you are of great value”. Although it is tiny, I think L. serrulata is a stunning plant—it has attractive mint-green and bronze feathery leaves with fine silvery hairs, and lemon-yellow button flower heads held proudly above the mat-forming rosettes. Although I haven’t had the pleasure of seeing it in full bloom, apparently the flowers “have a sweet honey dew scent.” (The Plant Store 2021).</p>
<h2>Distribution:</h2>
<p>Leptinella serrulata is endemic to New Zealand. It occurs in the South Island east of the main divide, mainly inland from Marlborough (Wairau River), Canterbury, and Otago south to Foveaux Strait (see map taken from iNaturalist NZ 2021). Habitat Leptinella serrulata occurs from sea level to 1500 m a.s.l. It grows in dry, free-draining sites on the Canterbury Plains, along river flats, and in intermontane basins, where it grows in open sites amongst tussock grassland or under kānuka (Kunzea serotina) shrubland. It is more rarely found in coastal sites, where it colonises open sandy ground (Kaitorete Spit and Tiwai Peninsula are important strongholds for the species).</p>
<h2>Current population:</h2>
<p>Leptinella serrulata has scattered, small populations across the eastern South Island. The species is classified as ‘At Risk – Declining’, with the qualifier ‘SP’ or sparse (de Lange et al. 2018), which means that it naturally occurs within typically small and widely scattered sub populations. The species only has 35 observations by 16 people on the iNaturalist website (iNaturalistNZ 2021), which illustrates how few New Zealanders have been lucky enough to see this little gem.</p>
<h2>Threats:</h2>
<p>Leptinella serrulata faces many of the same threats as our other native dryland plant species. Habitat loss, modification, and weed invasion are major causes of population decline, with the primary driver being agricultural intensification (i.e. cultivation, fertilisation, and/or irrigation). Because of its diminutive stature, the species is unable to compete with introduced grasses and herbs such as hawkweeds (Pilosella officinarum and Hieracium spp.). Coastal erosion is also a long-term threat to the populations on the Tiwai Peninsula.</p>
<h2>What do we need to do right now?</h2>
<p>We need to raise awareness about Leptinella serrulata and the special flora (and fauna) of the eastern South Island drylands, and to advocate for better protection and management of these threatened ecosystems. Leptinella serrulata makes an ideal ground cover for sunny, dry/well-drained spots in the garden—why not try planting it at home so you can enjoy looking at this iconic dryland plant every day!</p>

    <p>
      The Plant Names Database lists over 46,000 names and is a primary source of information for Ngā Tipu o Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants. The purpose of the New Zealand Plant Names Database is to provide an authoritative record of the scientific names, taxonomic concepts (i.e., synonymies), and biostatus for the lichens, liverworts, mosses, ferns, freshwater algae and seed plants in New Zealand. It also records the associated literature, vernacular and Māori names, as well as recently published keys and descriptions for some taxa. Editorial work on the Plant Names Database is ongoing and as new treatments, taxa and naturalisations are published these are added to the database.
