        <p>Gavin and Forest &amp; Bird’s Tautuku project manager Francesca Cunninghame returned to the site, on a wet and cold low ridge, with a suitably long measuring tape.</p>
<p>“The whole ridgeline is full of large rātā of all angles, shapes, and sizes. They are part of the landscape,” said Francesca. “But this tree appears through the undergrowth and makes people stop in their tracks and take a second look.</p>
<p>“We arrived at the site and saw this wizened gnarled old tree at an angle, and there was no question about it – it was much larger than all the other huge rātā we had passed.</p>
<p>”Their initial measurements suggested it was comparable to two recognised giant northern rātā (M. robusta) – Rātānui, in Forest &amp; Bird’s Tarapuruhi Bushy Park Sanctuary, near Whanganui, and the Karapoti rātā in the Tararua Ranges, north of Wellington.</p>
<p>Francesca called in the experts to help figure out just how big the tree is and whether it could be a record-breaker.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, botanists Brian Rance and John Barkla, together with Gavin White, carried out two plant surveys of the mid-Tautuku catchment, including a close inspection of the giant rātā.</p>
<p>The pair measured its diameter at breast height (dbh) of 4.036m and estimated it to be more than 30m tall, with the top of the tree emergent above the kāmahi canopy.</p>
<p>Rātā are recorded to live up to 500 years. However, this massive tree is almost certainly older. In fact, Brian thinks it may more than 700 years old!</p>
<p>“This tree is larger than any southern rātā in the New Zealand Tree Register. Is it the largest southern rātā in the Catlins, Southland, or possibly New Zealand?” John and Brian concluded in a summary of their survey report.</p>
<p>The giant rātā had 22 different plants growing on it, including nine shrubs and trees – kāmahi, rimu, miro, broadleaf, three finger, haumakoroa, matipo, stinkwood and Coprosma colensoi, 11 different ferns, bush flax (<em>Astelia fragrans</em>), and Easter orchid.</p>
<h4>TURNING THE TRAMWAY</h4>
<p>There is another special rātā in Forest &amp; Bird’s project area, on Department of Conservation land about 170m outside the Lenz Reserve boundary. It has creamy white flowers and is known locally as the “white rātā”. It survived being chopped down in 1935, when a tramline was being built deep into the forest to allow woodcutters access. The men build-ing the tramway noticed the white rātā and decided to build the tram tracks around it so it wouldn’t have to be cut down. You can still see the lean in the old sleepers at that exact spot today.</p>

      The Plant Names Database lists over 46,000 names and is a primary source of information for Ngā Tipu o Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants. The purpose of the New Zealand Plant Names Database is to provide an authoritative record of the scientific names, taxonomic concepts (i.e., synonymies), and biostatus for the lichens, liverworts, mosses, ferns, freshwater algae and seed plants in New Zealand. It also records the associated literature, vernacular and Māori names, as well as recently published keys and descriptions for some taxa. Editorial work on the Plant Names Database is ongoing and as new treatments, taxa and naturalisations are published these are added to the database.
